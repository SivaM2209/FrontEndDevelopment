    <h3 class="AbtDiaAll">Diagon Alley is a cobblestoned wizarding alley and shopping area 
        located in London, England behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron. Inside the alley 
        is an assortment of restaurants, shops, and other sights. All items on the Hogwarts 
        supply list can be bought at Diagon Alley.The alley was completely hidden from the 
        Muggle world, which was right outside of its boundaries. It was very large in area 
        and essentially the centre of wizarding London. Consequently, the demand for space 
        here was steep, and rent costed “loads of Galleons”. The Leaky Cauldron was present 
        long before Charing Cross Road was even planned in the nineteenth century; its true 
        address was number one, Diagon Alley, and it was believed to have been built some time 
        in the early 1500s, along with the rest of the wizarding street.</h3>

    <h3 class="AbtTheBurrow">The Burrow was the family home of the Weasley family, located on 
        the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. It was a thoroughly magical 
        dwelling that became a second home to Harry Potter. A barn and chicken coop stood 
        nearby.The Burrow was held up with magic and was very cluttered inside, but very 
        welcoming at the same time. It was also stated that it was quite near to the 
        Lovegood House. In 1997, following the death of Albus Dumbledore, the Burrow became 
        the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix.The Weasleys were forced to abandon their 
        home during the height of the Second Wizarding War when they became targets of the 
        Death Eaters. Arthur and Molly also moved back to the Burrow following the Battle 
        of Hogwarts. Their home eventually became "quite the photo op for wizarding history 
        buffs".</h3>
